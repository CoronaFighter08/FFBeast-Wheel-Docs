# Example Builds

idea is to add multiple builds (aside from the reference assembly) here from the Discord, provided the owners give permission, and to provide details, parts used, link to the Discord thread, etc so that new builders can take inspiration instead of just going off of the reference assembly or the somewhat questionable builds available online like on Youtube
