# Example Builds

This page features a few builds made by community members which serve as an example as to how unique your own build can be, ranging from different enclosure designs to encoder types, mounting solutions, etc. Make what you want to make! You don't need to follow any specific tutorial with such a DIY project ;)

{% hint style="info" %}
All the builds below are publicly available on the FFBeast Discord server. You're highly encouraged to check the #showcase and #showcase-archive channels there as they have many more builds available for viewing than shown here.

Modified version of the "example build" available on the main doc, however featuring Viih's magnetic encoder mount instead of the  outdated bike spoke connection method.

Custom 3D printed slide on case designed around the original PCB and example build with SK16 mounting method.

Case is available at [https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/game/ffbeast-slide-on-case-rennkraft](https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/game/ffbeast-slide-on-case-rennkraft) .

Steering away (pun intended) from the example build, this one uses part of the hoverboard itself as the case and mount, along with a belt driven optical encoder, custom quick release with USB passthrough via a slipring, and the motor face being grinded down to give a really clean look!

[**Dravakiirm's Build**](https://discord.com/channels/1043156600468287539/1411791833725534348)

Featuring an extremely unique mounting method, this mostly 3D printed build uses metal "rigid flange couplings" to mount the hoverboard motor. It also includes a cooling fan, slipring USB passthrough, relays for backflow protection, and more! Definitely worth checking out.

[**DrowsySam's Build**](https://app.gitbook.com/u/cPZIxqyrGtSv7lb4Nej9u3XgPtD3)

Another build using the original hoverboard base as the mount and (part of) the case to give it a really clean look. Includes a 3D printed base to add a 25 degree angle, a hoverboard motor with its face turned down in a lathe, belt driven optical encoder, small fan for cooling, and more.

[**theViz's Build**](https://discord.com/channels/1043156600468287539/1425835934150295602)

A unique build including many custom metal parts. It includes a case made out of 3D printed parts and aluminium extrusions, a metal spacer attached to the motor which is held in place with a bearing, gear driven magnetic encoder, and much more.
