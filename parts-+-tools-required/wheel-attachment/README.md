# Wheel Attachment

## Hard Mounting (Hub Spacer)

{% column %}
Using a cheap hub spacer (commonly available on Aliexpress) is an easy way to mount your steering wheel to your motor, as long as you don't intend to often switch between different wheels. The 6 bolt, 70mm spacer shown on the left is a common find and most wheels available online can be bolted on (but make sure it's compatible just in case!).&#x20;

Make sure to purchase one of suitable length - if mounting your wheelbase on your desk for example, you don't want your spacer to be so long that it positions you away from your pedals.

## Quick Release (QR)

{% column %}
Cheap QRs are also available from places like Aliexpress, allowing you to quickly swap out wheels without having to tediously remove bolts. Something to keep in mind is that extremely cheap QRs can have some "play" in them, distracting you while driving. Also, make sure to buy quick releases which also have the wheel side mount available for sale separately (how else will you buy them for the rest of your wheels?).

With these, you often don't need a separate hub spacer as they provide sufficient spacing for paddle shifters and such.

## 3D Printed Options

While using 3D printed parts for wheel attachments isn't recommended due to the forces exerted on them during usage, it CAN be done successfully. I'd recommend using a strong and heat resistant filament like PETG or ABS, and to focus on finding parts specifically designed for use with DD wheelbases. Prioritize more walls over greater infill when slicing, as that's where the strength comes from.

Here are two 3D printed options which have been successfully used by FFBeast community members:

## 70mm Drill Guide

Here's a useful 3D printed drill guide for drilling six M5 holes into your hoverboard motor case for a 70mm spacer / quick release!
