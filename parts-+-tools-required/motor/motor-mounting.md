# Motor Mounting

## SK16 Mounting

SK16 linear shaft supports offer a decent mounting method for your motor. If you take a look around the FFBeast Discord, you'll mainly see two types: one where the entire mounting and positioning is done by the use of six SK16 supports along with a shaft of 16mm diameter, or those where two SK16s hold the motor itself but are connected to an aluminium profile, 3D printed block or something else.

<mark style="color:$primary;">One thing you need to be careful of when using SK16s is that they have to be tightened down really hard to prevent the motor shaft from slipping which can cause issues with force feedback later on</mark><mark style="color:$primary;">.</mark>

## Original Hoverboard Mount

An easier alternative is to just use the original hoverboard shell itself as a mount. It has a block which screws down with 4 bolts and clamps onto the flat side of the motor shaft so there is zero risk of the shaft slipping. Most people mount these by either clamping it directly to their desk or drilling holes into the shell to provide mounting points.

## 3D Printed Mount

Yes, you _can_ completely 3D print the motor mount... IF you take precautions. Use heat resistant filament like PETG or ABS. Increase the number of perimeters and infill for added strength. Ensure that there's a way for the mount to make use of the motor shaft's flat section or else it WILL slip. I personally wouldn't recommend running up to 15 Nm of torque through a 3D printed mount unless you know what you're doing while designing it.&#x20;

A bad example of a 3D printed mount is Daz Project's fully 3D printed build posted on Youtube which is known to have many issues including the mount melting, slipping, etc. The files cost 15 euros (and 20 euros for an updated version!!) which you could use to fund proper wheel and motor mounting solutions.. so the critisism is deserved. I wouldn't follow his guide unless it's used as inspiration to make custom parts which perform better, which some members have done.
