# Parts + Tools Required

There is no one "correct" way to construct an FFBeast wheel. Builds can vary on the parts' availability, tools on hand, your budget, ease of assembly, and much more, so we can't give you a pre-made BOM. However the things you'll need for a common build are:

* [BLDC Motor](motor.md).
* [Controller](controller.md).
* [Encoder](encoder/).
* [Power Supply](power-supply.md).
* [A Wheel Attachment](wheel-attachment/).
* [An Enclosure](enclosure.md) (optional).
* Mounting Hardware (example builds include these).
* Screws, bolts, etc.
* Build specific items (timing belts, 3d printed parts, aluminum profiles, etc).

***

You can also expect to be using the following tools depending on how your wheel is constructed:

* Powered drill (holes for wheel attachment, cooling, encoder wire passthrough, slip rings, etc).
* Soldering iron (wiring for encoder, power, wheel, etc).
* Hand saw (cutting wood, aluminum, etc).
* Multimeter (troubleshooting electrical issues).
* Etc.

We highly suggest taking a look at the [example builds](../example-builds.md) provided. They include FFBeast wheel builds made by members of our community which feature parts used, pictures and other details which you can use to plan your own build based on your own requirements!
