# Enclosure

While not necessary, you'll want an enclosure unless you want your wheel base's internals and wiring out in the open for everyone to ogle at. Jokes aside, an enclosure can greatly improve the look of your build and help with keeping everything contained, keeping dust out, providing safety for and against the electronics inside, etc etc...&#x20;

There are multiple enclosure designs available online, most if not all of them being 3D printed. Some keep the hoverboard motor outside of the case while others encapsulate the entire thing. Some builds don't even need a separate enclosure as they use the hoverboard case itself for mounting the motor, and the case \*becomes\* the enclosure!

## Deciding On An Enclosure Design (Or Making Your Own)

Since FFBeast builds can greatly vary, here are some things you should look out for when either finding a design online or modelling your own to make:

* Is the enclosure compatible with your motor mounting solution?
* Is it compatible with your encoder and its mounting? Is there enough space for it to fit inside?
* Which ODrive controller is the design based for? Will you be able to mount yours inside?
* Connectors. How many and which type of connectors does it use?
* Is the motor mounted inside or outside? If it's inside, is there some cooling solution included?
* Is there adequete cooling for your motor driver?

You may also look into mounting solutions for other accessories (such as backflow protection relays, USB hubs, etc). Some designs also incorporate fans for extra cooling.&#x20;



When it comes to 3D printing your enclosure, you don't have to go overboard with it as it shouldn't (theoretically) be interfering with your motor mounting solution and should therefore have no extreme forces being applied to it. If your motor is mounted inside the enclosure, it might be a good idea to print in some heat resistant filament like PETG or ABS.

It's also a good idea to take a look at the [example builds](../example-builds.md) to see how others have enclosed their builds. You may be inspired to design your own!
