# Introduction

### About This Website

Welcome! This is a **community-ran** documentation website providing details on building FFBeast based direct drive FFB wheels. Whether you're a newcomer looking to build a wheel on a budget or an experienced builder looking for inspiration, the information provided here should be able to help you!

We encourage you to first check out the [official documentation](https://ffbeast.github.io/) as it will provide the most up-to-date information directly from the developer(s) of this project. This is also the case if you're looking to build the FFB Flight Control project, as information regarding it is not provided here.

### The FFBeast Wheel

Based on ODrive / ODESC controller boards and BLDC motors, this project's aim is to build a **high torque direct drive wheel**, which rivals branded alternatives, on a relatively **low budget**. By carefully selecting and purchasing parts, one can build a cost effective DD wheel capable of outputting up to **15Nm** of torque for less than **$150**. If this is something you wish to pursue, use the menu on the left to get started. All the information is provided in the correct order. However before doing so, please read the important notes below!

### Before You Start...

Before jumping into building your own FFBeast wheel, there are a few things to keep in mind. This is a **technical DIY project**. It will involve the use of power tools, basic electrical knowledge, soldering, and the ability to troubleshoot. Depending on how you build your wheel, you may be 3D modelling and printing parts, soldering tiny components, and much more. At the very least it will require your free time. If you're looking for a plug & play solution with no fuss involved, this project is NOT for you!\

We also recommend you join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Gt6rnvrZKu) where you can chat with other wheel builders, ask for help, take inspiration from other builds and much more.\

With that out of the way, use the page menu on the left or the next page button at the bottom to begin!
